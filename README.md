# DA-Baby-Steps

This is the repository of my Day 1 in the program of 30Days of Learning programme with https://twitter.com/TheOyinbooke

After the watching tutorials and doing the task, I am uploading my first github repository on this journey.

I worked on a sample finanacial report.

Problem Statement: 
I tried to generate insight to the business problem to know where and what is selling in each location.

Data Source: 
The data source is the file downloaded from the training website.

Data Cleaning: 
I created a new copy of the file, this will help me keep the original file and should incase I have to make reference to the main file after cleaning it.  I also, filtered the file to check for duplicates, remove rows without full details of the content.

Findings: 
I discovered after analysis that Canada has the highest number of product unit sold in the time frame and gross the highest profit.  Paseo has the highest quantity sold among all the products and sold the most in Canada.

Recommendation:
More focus should be placed on Germany to understand why sales is low in the country
